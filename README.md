# Credit-Card-Fault-Detection

Visit https://www.kaggle.com/akshitagarwal10/predicting-fraud-unsupervised-deep-learning#

Made a kernel on kaggle to identify anomilies (faulty transactions or frauds) given a highly skewed credit card dataset. Tried multiple approaches:
 - Isolation forest, local outlier factor
 - Deep learning
 - Multivariate Gaussian Anomaly detection
 
 Also used tSNE to visualize the high dimensional data in 2d frame.
 Its an ongoing work and is still continously tweaking the model to improve the results.
 Link given at the top will lead you to the kernel (Vote up if you liked it and suggestions to improve it are surely welcomed !!)
